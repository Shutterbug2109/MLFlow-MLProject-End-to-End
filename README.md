# MLFlow-MLProject-End-to-End

# Create template.py file to create a folder structure for MLFlow project
# create requirements.txt file to install all the dependencies
# create logging file to log all the information in constructor file of src MLFlow project so that you can see all the information in MLFlow UI and no need to define logger file separately in each file

# In the main.py you can directly import the logger as ( from MLFlowProject import logger ) and use it in the main.py file. This also helps to debug the code and see the logs in the MLFlow UI or in the console.

# make utils.py to have common functions which can be used in the project
